This is the source code for <a href="https://drasty.com/"><i lang="enm">Drasty Speche</i></a>, a celebration of Geoffrey Chaucer, a master of shitposting. Feel free to file issues or make suggestions in this repository!

The plan is to kick things off for real some time in April.

The site is generated using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/).

## Local usage

From the command line: `npx eleventy` â€” which will generate the site into a `_site` directory.
