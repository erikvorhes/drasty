This is the source code for <a href="https://drasty.com/"><i lang="enm">Drasty Speche</i></a>, a celebration of Geoffrey Chaucer, a master of shitposting. Feel free to file issues or make suggestions in this repository!

The plan is to kick things off for real some time in April 2020.

The site is generated using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/) and deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/181a5a3a-61f9-4881-a36d-02446a43a344/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/drasty/deploys)

## Local usage

From the command line:

```
$ cd drasty
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

Static content will be generated into a `_site` directory to deploy.

## Themes, because why not?

For kicks Iâ€™m going to add a theming selector, based on various manuscripts containing the <cite>Canterbury Tales</cite>.
